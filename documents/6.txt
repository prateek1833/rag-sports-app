The NIT Srinagar Chess Championship 2024 saw fierce competition among 64 participants from different departments. Held over five days in the seminar hall, matches followed a rapid round-robin format, with time controls ensuring exciting endgames. Arjun Kumar, a third-year student, emerged victorious after a tense final against the defending champion. His strategy involved a calm opening, strong middle-game control, and masterful endgame technique. Spectators watched silently as the final match unfolded with each move calculated and precise. Chess enthusiasts from the faculty also participated in exhibition rounds. The event wasnâ€™t just about victory; it showcased critical thinking and mental discipline. Workshops on chess tactics and puzzles were also organized during the breaks. Winners received medals, certificates, and vouchers from a popular bookstore. The tournament emphasized the cognitive side of sports and encouraged students to view chess as both a competitive and meditative activity. Plans are already underway for an inter-college chess league.
