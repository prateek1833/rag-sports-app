As part of the Alumni Connect Week, a friendly football match was organized between the current college football team and alumni players from the past ten batches. The match took place on the main sports ground under floodlights, giving it a professional feel. Despite the “friendly” tag, both teams played competitively, displaying impressive stamina and coordination. The alumni team, featuring past captains and college-level players, used their experience to maintain possession and control the game’s tempo. The student team started strong but missed a couple of chances. The final score was 2–1 in favor of the alumni, with the winning goal scored in the last 5 minutes. The crowd included faculty, students, and visiting alumni, all cheering loudly. Post-match, players exchanged jerseys, and a group photo was taken. The evening concluded with a networking dinner and speeches from former sports captains. The event reminded everyone of the legacy and continuity that sports build over generations. Plans are underway to make this match an annual tradition.
