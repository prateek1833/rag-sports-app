On World Mental Health Day, the college organized a 10-kilometer marathon titled “Run for the Mind.” Over 500 students, faculty members, and alumni participated. The run began at the main gate and passed through scenic areas of the campus. The Dean of Student Welfare flagged off the event. Volunteers managed water booths, cheering participants, while medical teams were on standby.

The aim was to promote mental well-being and reduce the stigma around mental health. At the finish line, information booths offered free consultations and wellness kits. Participants received T-shirts with motivational quotes like “Strong Mind, Strong Life.” Guest speakers shared personal experiences of overcoming stress and anxiety.

Funds collected from registrations were donated to student counseling services. The initiative was widely appreciated, with many requesting such events be held regularly. The marathon highlighted how sports can effectively promote mental and emotional wellness.
